Overview
Freshdesk is a cloud-based customer support platform that was founded with the mission of enabling companies of all sizes to provide great customer service. Our goal is simple: make it easy for brands to talk to their customers and make it easy for users to get in touch with businesses.

Freshdesk's APIs belong to the Representational State Transfer (REST) category. They allow you to perform 'RESTful' operations such as reading, modifying, adding or deleting data from your helpdesk. The APIs also support Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS).

Note:
This documentation is for the v2.0 of the APIs. Documentation for the v1.0 APIs can be found here.

What API commands are used by Freshdesk?
Freshdesk APIs are plain JSON over HTTP and use the following HTTP verbs:

Command	Purpose
POST	Create an object
GET	Fetch one or more objects
PUT	Update an object
DELETE	Remove an object
Note:
All API requests should hit the secured endpoint, that is, only HTTPS

What's New
Version 2 of the API brings several new features as well as changes to the previous APIs. This section highlights some of the new features introduced in v2.

Higher rate limits as a result of significant performance enhancements
Improved error handling - errors will return appropriate HTTP status codes and an error body
Four new API categories - Business Hours, Products, Email Configs, and SLAs
New APIs that enable you to Reply to a ticket and enhancements to existing APIs that enable you to Update a ticket's description, Update a ticket's notes, and Retrieve a list of tickets that have been recently modified
XML Support has been deprecated, only JSON is supported
Only SSL calls (HTTPS) will be allowed
Works only via Freshdesk domains and not via custom CNAMEs
Support for page sizes up to 100 has been added
New API deprecation and breaking change policies
Some categories have been renamed for consistency with the web application. For example, Forums are now Discussions and Users are now Contacts
Rate Limit
The number of API calls per minute is based on your plan. This limit is applied on an account wide basis irrespective of factors such as the number of agents or IP addresses used to make the calls. For all trial users, there is a default API limit of 50 calls/minute.

If your account hasn't been switched to the new minute level APIs, please contact support@freshdesk.com to get the new rate limits enabled for your account. To view the old API rate limits, click here

Note: An account can purchase additional API calls, to increase the rate limit. Contact us to know more about our pricing policy and purchase additional API calls.

To view the limits in the older plans, click here.

Plan	Rate Limit/minute	Maximum rate limit/minute per endpoint
Growth	200	Ticket Create - 80
Ticket Update - 80
Tickets List - 20
Contacts List - 20
Pro	400	Ticket Create - 160
Ticket Update - 160
Tickets List - 100
Contacts List - 100
Enterprise	700	Ticket Create - 280
Ticket Update - 280
Tickets List - 200
Contacts List - 200
If you have purchased additional rate limits, the sub-limits are as follows:
-	1000	Ticket Create - 400
Ticket Update - 400
Tickets List - 300
Contacts List - 300
-	2000	Ticket Create - 800
Ticket Update - 800
Tickets List - 400
Contacts List - 400
Notes:
1. Ensure to follow the rate limit - best practices to stay within the rate limit.
2. Even invalid requests count towards the rate limit.
3. Some custom apps consume API calls and these calls also count towards the rate limit.

You can check your current rate limit status by looking at the following HTTP headers which are returned in response to every API request.

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8
X-Ratelimit-Total: 700
X-Ratelimit-Remaining: 426
X-Ratelimit-Used-CurrentRequest: 1
X-Freshdesk-Api-Version: latest=v2; requested=v2

Header Name	Description
X-RateLimit-Total	Total number of API calls allowed per minute.
X-RateLimit-Remaining	The number of requests remaining in the current rate limit window.
X-RateLimit-Used-CurrentRequest	The number of API calls consumed by the current request. Most API requests consume one call, however, including additional information in the response will consume more calls.
Retry-After	The number in seconds that you will have to wait to fire your next API request. This header will be returned only when the rate limit has been reached.
If your API request is received after the rate limit has been reached, Freshdesk will return an error in the response. The Retry-After value in the response header will tell you how long you need to wait before you can send another API request.

HTTP/1.1 429
Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8
Retry-After: 34

Policies
Freshdesk APIs are classified into either production or beta APIs. A production API is one that has been made generally available for public use and is stable. A beta API is one that is still in development or is for internal or limited use and whose stability cannot be guaranteed. Beta APIs may be removed or modified at any time without advance notice. The following policies apply to production APIs only.

Deprecation Policy
The current version of production level APIs is v2. When a new version of APIs is made generally available (not beta), the older version will be deprecated and will cease to function after six months. Once an API is removed, any request to it will result in a 404 error.

Note:
We will not remove any v1 API until similar functionality is present in the v2 APIs

Breaking Change Policy
Changes that do not break an API, such as adding a new attribute can be made at any time. Changes that break a production level API such as removing attributes or making major changes to the API’s behavior will only be done with an advance notice of 60 days. However, there may be rare occasions where due to legal, performance, or security reasons, we are forced to make breaking changes without advance notice.

Authentication
How does it work? Who can access my helpdesk? Can everybody see my data?
Before you can set the priority of a ticket or change a customer's name or use any of the APIs listed above, you need to "authenticate your ID" or "log in" in the same way as you log in to your helpdesk's web portal.

You can use your personal API key to authenticate the request. If you use the API key, there is no need for a password. You can use any set of characters as a dummy password.

curl -v -u apikey:X -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X GET 'https://domain.freshdesk.com/api/v2/tickets'

For example, if your API key is abcdefghij1234567890, the curl command to use is:

curl -v -u abcdefghij1234567890:X -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X GET 'https://domain.freshdesk.com/api/v2/tickets'

Where can I find my API key?
Log in to your Support Portal
Click on your profile picture on the top right corner of your portal
Go to Profile settings Page
Your API key will be available below the change password section to your right
For more information, please refer to this solution article

Note:
If you are sure that your credentials are correct, but are still unable to access your helpdesk, make sure that the "APIkey:X" is Base64-encoded before passing it as an "Authorization" header.

What are the resources available via the API?
Every single piece of information - be it a customer's ID or the priority of a specific ticket - can be identified by its own unique identifier or "URI". If you want your data from the helpdesk, whether via your smartphone app or via a third party service, you need this identifier. All URIs follow a specific format and that format is:

https://your_helpdesk_domain_name/api/v2/resource_name

For example, if you are Davy Jones and you are managing problems of drowned souls via your Freshdesk portal "thelocker.freshdesk.com", then to access the contacts in your helpdesk, the syntax would be

https://thelocker.freshdesk.com/api/v2/contacts

For tickets, it would be

https://thelocker.freshdesk.com/api/v2/tickets

Note:
We have shortened API resource URLs throughout this document by omitting the domain name. For example, /api/v2/tickets is actually https://domain.freshdesk.com/api/v2/tickets

Will everyone have the same access rights?
No, your ability to access data depends on the permissions available to your Freshdesk user profile. For example, if your Freshdesk Agent Role is "Newbie Agent" who is only allowed to view tickets but not reply to them, then you will not be able to use the APIs to reply to a ticket.

Schema
Blank Fields:
Blank fields are included as null instead of being omitted.

Timestamps:
All timestamps are returned in the UTC format, YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ. ( Example : 2016-02-13T23:27:49Z )

Date Fields:
Input for date fields is expected to be in one of the following formats:
YYYY-MM-DD
YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM
YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MMZ
YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS
YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ
YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS±hh:mm
YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS±hh
YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS±hhmm

Note:
If a custom field is a date field, ensure to specify the value in the YYYY-MM-DD format.

If the time zone information is not present, it will be assumed to be in UTC.
( some valid datefields : 2016-02-15T21:16:25Z,    2012-12-24T12:56:15+05:30,    2010-03-23T12:00 )
Location Header:
POST requests will contain the Location Header in the response that points to the URL of the created resource.

Response
HTTP STATUS: HTTP 201 Created
Headers:
"Location": https://domain.freshdesk.com/api/v2/tickets/1

Embedding
Our previous version of APIs returned a large number of fields by default. In order to increase performance and reduce data usage, we have removed several of these fields in our v2.0 APIs. For example, when you view a ticket, we no longer return the requester's name or the company name. However, there may be situations where these fields are required and hence, we have included a mechanism to embed additional resources into an API call in order to minimise the number of required API calls.

Note:
Embedding resources into an API will consume an additional API call credit per embedded resource.

You can request for additional resources using the "include" keyword. For example you can embed the requester's details within the ticket view API by using the following command

Sample Request
curl -v -u 'abcdefgh12345678:X' -X GET 'https://domain.freshdesk.com/api/v2/tickets/20?include=requester'

Sample Response

{
  "cc_emails" : ["user@cc.com"],

EXPAND ↓
Attachments
Attachments are supported for the following endpoints
Create a Ticket
Update a Ticket
Create a Contact
Update a Contact
Reply to a Ticket
Update a conversation
Please follow the guidelines listed below
Only files on your local machine can be attached using API.
The Content-Type should always be multipart/form-data for create/update requests with attachments.
The name of the file is preserved after it is attached i.e the filename sent in the response will be the same as the one in the request.
Sample code for dealing with attachments can be found here.
Errors
I have encountered an error. How do I debug it?
API requests that result in errors will return an appropriate HTTP status code to help you identify the type of error. You can use the table below to understand what each code means.

HTTP Status Code	Text	Description
400	Client or Validation Error	The request body/query string is not in the correct format. For example, the Create a ticket API requires the requester_id field to be sent as part of the request and if it is missing, this status code is returned.
401	Authentication Failure	Indicates that the Authorization header is either missing or incorrect. You can learn more about the Authorization header here.
403	Access Denied	This indicates that the agent whose credentials were used in making this request was not authorized to perform this API call. It could be that this API call requires admin level credentials or perhaps the Freshdesk portal doesn't have the corresponding feature enabled. It could also indicate that the user has reached the maximum number of failed login attempts or that the account has reached the maximum number of agents
404	Requested Resource not Found	This status code is returned when the request contains invalid ID/Freshdesk domain in the URL or an invalid URL itself. For example, an API call to retrieve a ticket with an invalid ID will return a HTTP 404 status code to let you know that no such ticket exists.
405	Method not allowed	This API request used the wrong HTTP verb/method. For example an API PUT request on /api/v2/tickets endpoint will return a HTTP 405 as /api/v2/tickets allows only GET and POST requests.
406	Unsupported Accept Header	Only application/json and */* are supported.
When uploading files multipart/form-data is supported.
409	Inconsistent/Conflicting State	The resource that is being created/updated is in an inconsistent or conflicting state. For example, if you attempt to Create a Contact with an email that is already associated with an existing user, this code will be returned.
415	Unsupported Content-type	Content type application/xml is not supported. Only application/json is supported.
429	Rate Limit Exceeded	The API rate limit allotted for your Freshdesk domain has been exhausted.
500	Unexpected Server Error	Phew!! You can't do anything more here. This indicates an error at Freshdesk's side. Please email us your API script along with the response headers. We will reach you out to you and fix this ASAP.

Error Response
In addition to the HTTP status code, most errors will also return a response body that contains more information to help you debug the error. A sample error response is shown below. The format of the error response body is explained after the example.

Sample Error
{
    "description":"Validation failed",
    "errors":[
        {
            "field":"name",
            "message":"Mandatory attribute missing",
            "code":"missing_field"
        }
    ]
}
			

Error Response Fields
Field	Description
field	The request field that triggerred this error. Applicable to HTTP 400 errors only.
message	Detailed error message.
code	Custom error code that is machine-parseable.

Error Codes
In addition to the the error message, the error response will also contain a error code that is machine-parseable. The following table lists the error codes and their descriptions.

Code	Description
missing_field	A mandatory attribute is missing. For example, calling Create a Contact without the mandatory email field in the request will result in this error.
invalid_value	This code indicates that a request contained an incorrect or blank value, or was in an invalid format.
duplicate_value	Indicates that this value already exists. This error is applicable to fields that require unique values such as the email address in a contact or the name in a company.
datatype_mismatch	Indicates that the field value doesn't match the expected data type. Entering text in a numerical field would trigger this error.
invalid_field	An unexpected field was part of the request. If any additional field is included in the request payload (other than what is specified in the API documentation), this error will occur.
invalid_json	Request parameter is not a valid JSON. We recommend that you validate the JSON payload with a JSON validator before firing the API request.
invalid_credentials	Incorrect or missing API credentials. As the name suggests, it indicates that the API request was made with invalid credentials. Forgetting to apply Base64 encoding on the API key is a common cause of this error.
access_denied	Insufficient privileges to perform this action. An agent attempting to access admin APIs will result in this error.
require_feature	Not allowed as a specific feature has to be enabled in your Freshdesk portal for you to perform this action.
account_suspended	Account has been suspended.
ssl_required	HTTPS is required in the API URL.
readonly_field	Read only field cannot be altered.
inconsistent_state	An email should be associated with the contact before converting the contact to an agent.
max_agents_reached	The account has reached the maximum number of agents.
password_lockout	The agent has reached the maximum number of failed login attempts.
password_expired	The agent's password has expired.
no_content_required	No JSON data required.
inaccessible_field	The agent is not authorized to update this field.
incompatible_field	The field cannot be updated due to the current state of the record.
Pagination
API responses that return a list of objects, such as View List of Tickets and View List of Contacts are paginated. To scroll through the pages, add the parameter page to the query string. The page number starts with 1.

https://domain.freshdesk.com/api/v2/contacts?page=2

By default, the number of objects returned per page is 30. This can be adjusted by adding the per_page parameter to the query string. The maximum number of objects that can be retrieved per page is 100. Invalid values and values greater than 100 will result in an error.

https://domain.freshdesk.com/api/v2/contacts?per_page=10

The per_page and page parameters can also be used together. The following example will retrieve the contacts from 11 to 20.

https://domain.freshdesk.com/api/v2/contacts?per_page=10&page=2

The 'link' header in the response will hold the next page url if exists. If you have reached the last page of objects, then the link header will not be set.

Headers:
"link":< https://domain.freshdesk.com/api/v2/tickets?filter=all_tickets&page=2>;rel="next"

Best Practices
Rate Limit
Whenever possible, please queue API calls at your end. This ensures that you can buffer calls on your end to avoid hitting the rate limit and retry API calls when you hit the rate limit after the retry-after time.
Cache non-volatile data on your end whenever it is feasible. For e.g. the mapping between agent name and ID is extremely unlikely to change. Hence, by caching it on the client side, you will be able to avoid API calls.
As soon as you recognise that a rate limit increase will be required in the future, contact us. This will make it possible for us to ensure that we are prepared to increase the limit as and when as it is needed.
Other
Avoid making API calls directly from a mobile app, rather send the request to your servers and make the API calls from there. This ensures that in the event of an API endpoint being modified, you will be able to make and deploy the change to your server rather than updating your app and forcing your users to the latest version.
Always use HTTP connection/multiplexing when making the API request. This will save some time while opening TCP connection to Freshdesk.
When retrieving a list of objects, avoid making calls referencing page numbers over 500 (deep pagination). These are performance intensive calls and you may suffer from extremely long response times.

Tickets
A ticket is an issue raised by a requester that need to be solved. It could be an urgent, high-priority problem exposing a security vulnerability. It could also be low priority question about a free T-shirt. Tickets are assigned to agents based on the agent's expertise and on the subject of the ticket.

List All Tickets
get  /api/v2/tickets
Use filters to view only specific tickets (those which match the criteria that you choose). By default, only tickets that have not been deleted or marked as spam will be returned, unless you use the 'deleted' filter.

Note:
1. By default, only tickets that have been created within the past 30 days will be returned. For older tickets, use the updated_since filter
2. A maximum of 300 pages (30000 tickets) will be returned.
3. When using filters, the query string must be URL encoded - see example
4. Use 'include' to embed additional details in the response. Each include will consume an additional 2 credits. For example if you embed the stats information you will be charged a total of 3 API credits for the call.
5. For accounts created after 2018-11-30, you will have to use include to get description.

Update the lookup field within a ticket
Note:
1.The lookup_parameter accepts either “display_id” (record ID) or “primary_field_value” (user defined record value)
2.The default value is “display_id”
3.The display_id can be found in the URL of the record. For example: “_0-1”
4.While the primary_field_value is defined by the user. For example: An ‘Order’ record can have an order number - #98765, here the primary_field_value will be “98765”

Outbound Messages
Freshdesk leverages the WhatsApp Business Platform to enable businesses to send proactive, templated notifications to clients who have explicitly opted-in for updates like order confirmations, shipping alerts, appointment reminders, and payment notifications.

The API rate limits for outbound messages cover both send and retrieve endpoints. These limits are set at 1,000 calls per minute for the Pro plan and 2,000 calls per minute for the Enterprise plan.

To comply with WhatsApp's policies, these outbound messages must use structured templates, which are:

Pre-Approved: Each template must be defined by the business and submitted to Meta for review and approval before it can be used. This ensures the content is non-promotional (for Utility and Authentication categories) or compliant (for Marketing categories).

Customizable: Templates are comprised of three main components:
Body (Mandatory): Plain text with placeholders (variables) for dynamic content.
Header (Optional): Can contain text, an image, video, or document attachment, or a title with variables.
Footer (Optional): Short, static text.
Buttons (Optional/Interactive): Can include Call-to-Action (e.g., website URL, phone call) or Quick Reply buttons for immediate user interaction.
Note: Template message delivery on WhatsApp Business Platform via public API is only available to customers on Pro and Enterprise tiers of our paid plans.

The components array injects dynamic data into pre-approved WhatsApp template placeholders.

Construction Guidelines:

Conditional Inclusion: Only include a component (header, body, or button) if its corresponding template section contains dynamic placeholders ({{1}}, {{2}}, ...). Omit the component object if the section is static.
Parameter Specification: The parameters array within each component must populate the placeholders in their exact order as they appear in the template.
Media Links: For image, document, or video parameters, provide a publicly accessible URL inside the component's link object.

Additional Examples
1. Get a list of contacts filtered by the email address. Since the email address is unique, you will get only one contact in the list.

curl -v -u yourapikey:X -X GET 'https://domain.freshdesk.com/api/v2/contacts?email=superman@gmail.com'
2. Get the first 20 verified contacts. By default, the contacts will be returned in alphabetical order.

curl -v -u yourapikey:X -X GET 'https://domain.freshdesk.com/api/v2/contacts?state=verified&per_page=20'
3. Get a list of contacts updated after a particular timestamp.

curl -v -u yourapikey:X -X GET 'https://domain.freshdesk.com/api/v2/contacts?updated_since=2018-01-19T02:00:00Z'
Search Contacts
get  /api/v2/contacts/autocomplete?term=[keyword]
Search for a contact using their name.

Note:
1. The search is case insensitive.
2. You cannot search with a substring. For example, a contact "John Jonz" can be looked up using "john", "Joh", "Jonz" and "jon". But it will not be returned when you search for "hn" or "nz".

Contact Export
In order to export contacts using the Freshdesk API, you'll need to make two different API calls.

Step 1: You'll first need to hit the following endpoint with details about your export. This will start the background job and get you a contact export ID.

post  api/v2/contacts/export
Parameters
Attribute	Type	Description
fields
Mandatory
object	Fields of the contacts to be exported
The following table lists the fields:
Attribute	Type	Description
default_fields
Mandatory
object	List of default fields of the contacts to be exported.
custom_fields
Mandatory
object	List of custom fields of the contacts to be exported.
Tip: If you are not sure about what to include in this request, you can use the List All Contact Fields to get a list of all contact fields in your Freshdesk account.

Sample code | Curl
curl -v -u yourapikey:X -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -X POST -d '{ "fields": { "default_fields": ["name", "email"], "custom_fields": [] } }' 'https://domain.freshdesk.com/api/v2/contacts/export'
Response
{
  "id": "d809986de1ed8a1abaeb363ac455e917b356e347"
}
Step 2: The contact export ID can be passed to another endpoint which will return a URL to the exported CSV file.

get  api/v2/contacts/export/[id]
This endpoint will return a valid URL to the CSV only when the export is done completely. The background job can take anywhere between a few seconds to several minutes to complete depending on the no of contacts and the no of fields you're including in your export. We recommend that you come up with a pre-defined interval and make the API call more than once in order to get the URL in the response.

Note: Every Freshdesk account will be restricted to running only one contact export at a time. Once the export is complete, the exported file can be accessed using the URL for 15 days, post which it will get removed automatically.

Sample code | Curl
curl -v -u yourapikey:X -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -X POST 'https://domain.freshdesk.com/api/v2/contacts/export/d809986de1ed8a1abaeb363ac455e917b356e347'

Roles
Roles allow you to create special privileges and profiles specifying what an agent can see and do within your Freshdesk support portal. These roles help you classify your team into different sections and assign them capabilities so that they get to do what they need to on their helpdesk, without getting in each other's way. They are especially useful for larger teams where there are different groups of employees trying to handle different things.

Note:
Only users with admin privileges can access the following APIs.

Attribute	Type	Description
description	string	Description of the Role
id	number	Unique ID of the Role
name	string	Name of the Role
default	boolean	Set to true if this is the default role
created_at	datetime	Role creation timestamp
updated_at	datetime	Role updated timestamp

Company Export
In order to export companies using the Freshdesk API, you'll need to make two different API calls.

Step 1: You'll first need to hit the following endpoint with details about your export. This will start the background job and get you a company export ID.

post  api/v2/companies/export
Parameters
Attribute	Type	Description
fields
Mandatory
object	Fields of the companies to be exported
The following table lists the fields:
Attribute	Type	Description
default_fields
Mandatory
object	List of default fields of the companies to be exported.
custom_fields
Mandatory
object	List of custom fields of the companies to be exported.
Tip: If you are not sure about what to include in this request, you can use the List All Company Fields to get a list of all company fields in your Freshdesk account.

Sample code | Curl
curl -v -u yourapikey:X -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -X POST -d '{ "fields": { "default_fields": ["name", "domain"], "custom_fields": [] } }' 'https://domain.freshdesk.com/api/v2/companies/export'
Response
{
  "id": "d809986de1ed8a1abaeb363ac455e917b356e347"
}
Step 2: The company export ID can be passed to another endpoint which will return a URL to the exported CSV file.

get  api/v2/companies/export/[id]
This endpoint will return a valid URL to the CSV only when the export is done completely. The background job can take anywhere between a few seconds to several minutes to complete depending on the no of companies and the no of fields you're including in your export. We recommend that you come up with a pre-defined interval and make the API call more than once in order to get the URL in the response.

Note: Every Freshdesk account will be restricted to running only one company export at a time. Once the export is complete, the exported file can be accessed using the URL for 15 days, post which it will get removed automatically.

Sample code | Curl
curl -v -u yourapikey:X -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -X POST 'https://domain.freshdesk.com/api/v2/companies/export/d809986de1ed8a1abaeb363ac455e917b356e347'

Custom Objects
Freshdesk offers objects that are native to a helpdesk system, like tickets, contacts, and companies. These objects form the core of any business and contain the basic information related to the issue (ticket) a particular customer (contact) mapped to an organization (company) is facing. This basic information might fall short in helping agents get the full context behind the ticket. And at scale, it becomes necessary to provide contextual support proactively.

With 'Custom Objects', powered by Freshworks Neo, you can create and bring in information specific to your business use-cases right within Freshdesk and enable your agents to offer a contextual and faster resolution. With 'Custom Objects' enabled in your account, you can create your custom data entities and thus extend the data model in Freshdesk to solve your business use-cases. More information about Custom Objects can be found here

Note: Custom Objects can be enabled on request for accounts on Enterprise plan.

Custom Object Attributes
Attributes are the properties of a Custom Object Schema. A Custom Object Schema has the following attributes.

Attributes	Type	Description	Required?
Name	String	Name of the Schema	Yes
Id	Integer	Auto-generated unique identifier for the Schema	Auto-generated
Fields	Array of Objects	Fields in the Schema	No

Retrieve A Record
get  /api/v2/custom_objects/schemas/{schema-id}/records/{record-id}
The response retrieves the specified record from an existing Custom Object with all the field values (including null values).

Note:
1. The version property tracks the revisions made to a Custom Object Record and prevents data loss when multiple agents update the same record.
2. When a record is created, its version is set to 1. Future retrievals will include the current version number, which must be included in updates to ensure changes apply to the latest version. If an outdated version is used, the update will fail to persist the new changes, ensuring no recent updates are lost.
3. To avoid conflicts, always fetch the latest version using the Record Fetch API, retain the version information, and include it in your update request.

Filter Records Of A Custom Object
get  /api/v2/custom_objects/schemas/schema_id/records?{field-name}{operator}{value}
The query parameters can be specified to filter the records. The query parameters is a list of conditions connected by the AND operator. A condition consists of three components i.e Operand, Operator and Value. For Custom Object records, Operand is the Field name and Value is the Field Value. Example: {field_name}{operator}{field_value}

Supported Operators
Operator	URL Encoded Equivalent	Description
=	=	Equal to
>	%5Bgt%5D=	Greater than
<	%5Blt%5D=	Less than
>=	%5Bgte%5D=	Greater than or equal to
<=	%5Blte%5D=	Less than or equal to
Note:
1. System fields 'created_time' and 'updated_time' can also be used as the Operands. These fields must be provided in YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss.SSSZ format.
2. The Operator and the Field value must be URL encoded (See sample code below)
3. The Operators != (Not equal to) and 'OR' are not supported
4. To filter records using a Lookup field, the ID of the Object should be specified as the field value.
- For Tickets, display_id should be used as the field value
- For Contacts, org_contact_id should be used as the field value.
- For Companies, org_company_id should be used as the field value
- For Custom Objects, id of the record should be used as the Lookup field value

Supported Request Parameters
Parameters	Type	Description
sort_by	string	Sort the records by the Field name
sort_order	string	Order of sorting the records (ASC or DESC)
Note:
1. Sorting can only be performed on the filterable fields. By default, the result is sorted on the Created Time
2. Although sorting can be performed on the dropdown fields, the order of data will be in an arbitrary fashion.

Solutions
An effective knowledge base solves two of the biggest help desk problems. First, since all agents have a common place to pool in and share solutions, you can be sure that customer responses are consistent throughout. Second, since customers can access and help themselves to solutions, they feel more confident about your business. And all the while, your support load reduces.

For better clarity, the Freshdesk knowledge base is categorized into a three level hierarchy - top level Categories that hold related Folders and Solution Articles inside each folder.

Categories
Categories broadly classify your solutions page into several sections. For example, you could place Shipping, Payments and Delivery related information under the Order Fulfilment category. Another interesting application of the top level category is when you are providing support across multiple brands or products.

Attribute	Type	Description
id	number	Unique ID of the solution category
name	string	Name of the solution category
description	string	Description of the solution category
visible_in_portals	array of numbers	List of portal IDs where this category is visible
created_at	datetime	Solution Category creation timestamp
updated_at	datetime	Solution Category updated timestamp
Create a Solution Category
post  /api/v2/solutions/categories
Parameters

Satisfaction Ratings
Every response to a customer satisfaction survey is recorded as a satisfaction rating. These ratings are used to generate a customer satisfaction report that you can use to see which of your agents have received the most number of happy ratings, and who hasn't been very helpful to your customers. This can help you in defining metrics in your support process more clearly and in training future support people based on results from the past.

Field Technicians
An existing contact can be converted to a field technician. To convert an agent to a field technician, first delete the agent; this converts them into a contact. Then, use the Make Field Technician API to convert the contact to a field technician
Make Field Technician
put  /api/v2/contacts/[id]/make_agent
To make a contact a field technician, use the Make Agent API.

Note:
1. Role associated to a field technician can only be of 'field technician role'.
2. A field technician cannot be an occasional agent.
3. Type needs to be field_agent.
4. A field technician can only be assigned ‘Group access (2)’ or ‘Restricted access (3)’ for the ticket_scope parameter. Default is 'Restricted access (3)'
5. There should be enough 'field technician licenses' in order to convert a contact into field technician. See how licenses can be purchased here.

Time Entries
The time tracking feature in Freshdesk lets you track the time spent by each agent on resolving tickets and thereby enables you to gain visibility on the helpdesk's overall performance. Freshdesk lets agents track the time they spend on a ticket with automatic start and stop timers. Agents can also manually log the time they have spent, and detail their activities during this period by adding comments to the time entries.
